That is why we offer a unique feature where all our digital gifts have no expiry.This means that the digital gift vouchers and tokens you purchase from us will not expire, so you can use them at your convenience.

                    <p>At Crystalgift, we understand that the value of some digital gifts may be more than what the recipient needs or wants to spend at a given time. That's why we offer the option of partial redemption for our digital gift vouchers and tokens.

                        With partial redemption, the recipient of a gift voucher or token can choose to redeem only a portion of its value, rather than using the entire value at once. This allows them to spread out their spending and use the gift over time, rather than feeling pressured to use it all at once.</p>
